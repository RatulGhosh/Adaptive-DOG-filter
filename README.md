# Adaptive-DOG-filter
A physiologically inspired adaptive
algorithm for noise removal in an image while preserving
significant amount of edge details. The algorithm is motivated by
the classical lateral inhibition based receptive field in the visual
system as well as the holistic approach of the well known bilateral
filter.
